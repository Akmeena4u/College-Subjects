'''Feature reduction using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a technique that involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features from a
larger set of features while preserving the essential information.'''

# Step 1: Preprocessing
# A. Load the image
image = io.imread('/content/sample_data/Images/photo.jpeg')

# B. Convert to grayscale
gray_image = color.rgb2gray(image)

# C. Flatten the image into a 1D vector
flattened_image = gray_image.flatten()

# Step 2: Feature Reduction with ACO
# A. Define the problem of feature reduction
# Let's assume you want to select N pixels from the flattened image.
num_features_to_select = 1000  # Adjust as needed

# B. Initialize ACO parameters
num_ants = 10

# Initialize a list to store the selected feature indices

# C. Implement the ACO algorithm
for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    for ant in range(num_ants):
        # Implement ant's feature selection logic here
        # For simplicity, we randomly select features (pixels) in this example
        selected_features = np.random.choice(len(flattened_image), num_features_to_select, replace=False)

        # Calculate the quality of the selected subset (you should replace this with your evaluation)

    # Select the best feature subset from this iteration
    best_subset = np.argsort(pheromone_levels)[-num_features_to_select:]

# Step 3: Reconstructing the Image
# B. Create a new image with only the selected pixels
